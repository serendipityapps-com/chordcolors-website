    <p><em>Free Trial.</em> The Service Free Trial ("Free Trial") is an opportunity for you to use the Service free of charge for any specified term, beginning on the date that you accept the Free Trial offer. The Free Trial will expire at the end of the specified trial period, regardless of whether or not you use the Service during the Free Trial period.</p>

    <p>We may withdraw or modify the Free Trial, or exchange the Service or offer for a similar service or offer, at any time, in our sole discretion. You will be charged then-current rates for the Service if we determine that you are not eligible for the Free Trial.</p>

    <p>Upon expiration of the Free Trial, you will not be charged and the Service will renew into the Free Service plan. However, if you upgrade to a paid plan and provide a future payment method during or at the end of your Free Trial, the Service will automatically renew at its then-current renewal price with no further action from you, until you cancel. You may cancel the Free Trial or the automatic renewal of the Service at any time prior to the end of the Free Trial by visiting your account and selecting the "cancel" link. If you choose to cancel Free Trial, any content or data you have entered into the service will only be retained for 60 days from the date of cancellation for customers with billing addresses in non-GDPR countries or 30 days from the date of cancellation for customers with billing addresses in GDPR countries.</p>

    <h2>MONITORING OF CONTENT; ACCOUNT TERMINATION POLICY</h2>
    <p>Serendipity Apps LLC generally does not pre-screen User Content. However, Serendipity Apps LLC reserves the right (but undertakes no duty) to do so and decide whether any item of User Content is appropriate and/or complies with this Agreement. Serendipity Apps LLC may remove any item of User Content and/or terminate a User's access to this Site or the Services found at this Site for posting or publishing any material in violation of this Agreement, or for otherwise violating this Agreement (as determined by Serendipity Apps LLC in its sole and absolute discretion), at any time and without prior notice. Serendipity Apps LLC may also terminate a User's access to this Site or the Services found at this Site if Serendipity Apps LLC has reason to believe the User is a repeat offender. If Serendipity Apps LLC terminates your access to this Site or the Services found at this Site, Serendipity Apps LLC may, in its sole and absolute discretion, remove and destroy any data and files stored by you on its servers.</p>

    <h2>DISCONTINUED SERVICES; END OF LIFE POLICY</h2>
    <p>Serendipity Apps LLC reserves the right to cease offering or providing any of the Services at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice. Although Serendipity Apps LLC makes great effort to maximize the lifespan of all its Services, there are times when a Service we offer will be discontinued or reach its End-of-Life ("EOL"). If that is the case, that product or service will no longer be supported by Serendipity Apps LLC, in any way, effective on the EOL date.</p>

    <p><em>Notice and Migration.</em> In the event that any Service we offer has reached or will reach EOL, we will attempt to notify you thirty or more days in advance of the EOL date. It is your responsibility to take all necessary steps to replace the Service by migrating to a new Service before the EOL date, or by entirely ceasing reliance on said Service before the EOL date. In either case, Serendipity Apps LLC will either offer a comparable Service for you to migrate to for the remainder of the term of your purchase, a prorated in-store credit, or a prorated refund, to be determined by Serendipity Apps LLC in its sole and absolute discretion. Serendipity Apps LLC may, with or without notice to you, migrate you to the most up-to-date version of the Service, if available. You agree to take full responsibility for any and all loss or damage arising from any such migration.</p>

    <p><em>No Liability.</em> Serendipity Apps LLC will not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension, or discontinuance of any of the Services we may offer or facilitate access to.</p>

    <h2>TRADEMARK AND/OR COPYRIGHT CLAIMS</h2>
    <p>Serendipity Apps LLC supports the protection of intellectual property. If you would like to submit (i) a trademark claim for violation of a mark on which you hold a valid, registered trademark or service mark, or (ii) a copyright claim for material on which you hold a bona fide copyright, please contact us at privacy@serendipityapps.com.</p>

    <h2>THIRD PARTY CONTENT, SITES, AND SERVICES</h2>
    <p>All transactions using Serendipity Apps LLC's services are between the transacting parties only. The Services may contain features and functionalities linking you or providing you with certain functionality and access to third party content, including websites, directories, servers, networks, systems, information and databases, applications, software, programs, products or services, and the Internet as a whole. We may also provide some content to you as part of the Services. However, Serendipity Apps LLC is not an agent of any transacting party, nor are we a direct party in any such transaction. Any such activities, and any terms associated with such activities, are solely between you and the applicable third-party. Similarly, we are not responsible for any third-party content you access with the Services, and you irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such sites and third-party content. Serendipity Apps LLC shall have no liability, obligation, or responsibility for any such correspondence, purchase, or promotion between you and any such third-party. You are solely responsible for investigating before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any third party. You are solely responsible for your dealings with any third party related to the Services, including the delivery of and payment for goods and services. Should you have any problems resulting from your use of any third-party services, or should you suffer data loss or other losses as a result of problems with any of your other service providers or any third-party services, we disclaim all liability.</p>

    <h2>FEES AND PAYMENTS; AUTOMATIC RENEWAL</h2>
    <p>The fees applicable for Serendipity Apps LLC service are available within the Services.</p>

    <p>Unless specifically agreed upon in writing between User and Serendipity Apps LLC at the commencement of a subscription term, at the conclusion of any service term, whether monthly, yearly, or otherwise, Serendipity Apps LLC will automatically renew the service for the same term and will charge the user's credit card or PayPal account on the first day of the renewal term.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">Price Changes</span>. Serendipity Apps LLC reserves the right to change its prices and fees at any time, and such changes shall be posted online at this Site and effective immediately without need for further notice to you. If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">Auto-Renewal Terms</span>. In order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of Services, all Services are offered on automatic renewal. Except for reasons described below in this section, automatic renewal automatically renews the applicable Service upon expiration of the then current term for a renewal period equal in time to the most recent service period. For example, if your last service period is for one year, your renewal period will typically be for one year. However, in the event renewal with the Payment Method on file fails, Serendipity Apps LLC may attempt to renew the applicable service for a period less than the original subscription period to the extent necessary for the transaction to succeed.</p>

    <p>Unless you disable the automatic renewal option, Serendipity Apps LLC will automatically renew the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will take payment from any Payment Method you have on file with Serendipity Apps LLC at Serendipity Apps LLC's then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the rates for the original service period. If you do not wish for any Service to automatically renew, you may elect to cancel renewal, in which case, your Services will terminate upon expiration of the then current term, unless you manually renew your Services prior to that date (in which case the Services will again be set to automatic renewal). In other words, should you elect to cancel your product and fail to manually renew your Services before they expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and Serendipity Apps LLC shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same.</p>

    <h2>ADDITIONAL RESERVATION OF RIGHTS</h2>
    <p>Serendipity Apps LLC expressly reserves the right to deny, cancel, terminate, suspend, lock, or modify access to (or control of) any Account or Services for any reason (as determined by Serendipity Apps LLC in its sole and absolute discretion), including but not limited to the following: (i) to correct mistakes made by Serendipity Apps LLC in offering or delivering any Services, (ii) to protect the integrity and stability of, and correct mistakes made by, any third party (iii) to assist with our fraud and abuse detection and prevention efforts, (iv) to comply with court orders against you and/or your domain name or website and applicable local, state, national and international laws, rules and regulations, (v) to comply with requests of law enforcement, including subpoena requests, (vi) to comply with any dispute resolution process, (vii) to defend any legal action or threatened legal action without consideration for whether such legal action or threatened legal action is eventually determined to be with or without merit, (viii) to avoid any civil or criminal liability on the part of Serendipity Apps LLC, its officers, directors, employees and agents, as well as Serendipity Apps LLC's affiliates, including, but not limited to, instances where you have sued or threatened to sue Serendipity Apps LLC, or (ix) to respond to an excessive amount of complaints related in any way to your Account, domain name(s), or content on your website that could result in damage to Serendipity Apps LLC's business, operations, reputation or shareholders.</p>

    <p>Serendipity Apps LLC expressly reserves the right to terminate, without notice to you, any and all Services where, in Serendipity Apps LLC's sole discretion, you are harassing or threatening Serendipity Apps LLC and/or any of Serendipity Apps LLC's employees.</p>

    <p><span class="underline">Serendipity Apps LLC Content</span>.

    <h2>REFUND OF CHARGES</h2>
    <p>Except as specifically set forth in this section, all Serendipity Apps LLC services are prepaid for the period selected (monthly, yearly or otherwise) and are non-refundable. This includes accounts that are renewed in accordance with the previous section.</p>

    <p>Users on our free 30-day trial may cancel or downgrade their accounts, free of charge, at any time up until 30 days after their account was created. The day of creation constitutes the first day of the 30-day trial.</p>

    <p>When paying users cancel their account, they will not be issued refunds for their most recent (or any previous) billing. The single exception to this is NON-TRIAL annual subscribers. Annual subscribers who wish to cancel or downgrade and request a refund may do so within 30 days of the day on which they were charged for their account; in these cases, only a partial refund equivalent to 80% of the annual fee will be returned. Other requests for refunds may be processed at the sole discretion of a Serendipity Apps LLC staff member.</p>

    <p>All cancellations and downgrades are processed automatically. To cancel or downgrade, please click the link or button that says "Cancel" and follow the instructions.</p>

    <p>If you have a question while canceling your account, you must give our email staff adequate time to respond to your message. Delays in our support system do not qualify as a reason to extend your trial period, or excuse canceling after 30 days. Cancellation requests sent via email to privacy@serendipityapps.com will not be processed and will be replied to with an automatic response. You must use our form to process your cancellation.</p>

    <h2>DISPUTES, BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS</h2>
    <p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW IF YOU WISH TO OPT OUT OF THE PROVISIONS REQUIRING YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION.</p>

    <p>(A) Disputes. The terms of this Section shall apply to all Disputes between you and Serendipity Apps LLC. For the purposes of this Section, "Dispute" shall mean any dispute, claim, or action between you and Serendipity Apps LLC arising under or relating to any Serendipity Apps LLC Services or Products, Serendipity Apps LLC's websites, these Terms, or any other transaction involving you and Serendipity Apps LLC, whether in contract, warranty, misrepresentation, fraud, tort, intentional tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis, and shall be interpreted to be given the broadest meaning allowable under law. YOU AND Serendipity Apps LLC AGREE THAT "DISPUTE" AS DEFINED IN THESE TERMS SHALL NOT INCLUDE ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BY YOU OR Serendipity Apps LLC FOR (i) TRADE SECRET MISAPPROPRIATION, (ii) PATENT INFRINGEMENT, (iii) COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT OR MISUSE, AND (iv) TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT OR DILUTION. Moreover, notwithstanding anything else in these Terms, you agree that a court, not the arbitrator, may decide if a claim falls within one of these four exceptions.</p>

    <p>(B) Binding Arbitration. You and Serendipity Apps LLC further agree: (i) to arbitrate all Disputes between the parties pursuant to the provisions in these Terms; (ii) these Terms memorialize a transaction in interstate commerce; (iii) the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §1, et seq.) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Section; and (iv) this Section shall survive termination of these Terms. ARBITRATION MEANS THAT YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JUDGE OR JURY IN A COURT PROCEEDING AND YOUR GROUNDS FOR APPEAL ARE LIMITED. The arbitrator may award you the same damages as a court sitting in proper jurisdiction, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in this Agreement and may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. In addition, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and enforceable by any court with jurisdiction over the parties.</p>

    <p>(C) Small Claims Court. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may bring an individual action in the small claims court of your state or municipality if the action is within that court's jurisdiction and is pending only in that court.</p>

    <p>(D) Dispute Notice. In the event of a Dispute, you or Serendipity Apps LLC must first send to the other party a notice of the Dispute that shall include a written statement that sets forth the name, address and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the Dispute, and the relief requested (the "Dispute Notice"). The Dispute Notice to Serendipity Apps LLC must be addressed to: Serendipity Apps LLC, Attn.: Legal Department, privacy@serendipityapps.com. The Dispute Notice to you will be sent by certified mail to the most recent address we have on file or otherwise in our records for you. If Serendipity Apps LLC and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within sixty (60) days after the Dispute Notice is received, you or Serendipity Apps LLC may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to this Section. Following submission and receipt of the Dispute Notice, each of us agrees to act in good faith to seek to resolve the Dispute before commencing arbitration.</p>

    <p>(E) WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS AND CLASS ARBITRATIONS. YOU AND Serendipity Apps LLC AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTIONS, OR CLASS ARBITRATIONS. NEITHER YOU NOR Serendipity Apps LLC WILL SEEK TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD AS A CLASS ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH EITHER PARTY ACTS OF PROPOSES TO ACT IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. NO ARBITRATION OR OTHER PROCEEDING WILL BE COMBINED WITH ANOTHER WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES TO ALL AFFECTED ARBITRATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS.</p>

    <p>(F) Arbitration Procedure. If a party elects to commence arbitration, the arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the AAA ("AAA Rules") in conjunction with the rules set forth in these Terms, except that AAA may not administer any multiple claimant or class arbitration, as the parties agree that the arbitration shall be limited to the resolution only of individual claims. The AAA Rules are at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If there is a conflict between the AAA Rules and the rules set forth in these Terms, the rules set forth in these Terms shall govern. You may, in arbitration, seek any and all remedies otherwise available to you pursuant to federal, state, or local laws, as limited by the Limitation of Liability set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement. All Disputes shall be resolved by a single neutral arbitrator, and both parties shall have a reasonable opportunity to participate in the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by these Terms. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to rule on his or her own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence, scope, or validity of the arbitration agreement or to the arbitrability of any claim or counterclaim. Notwithstanding this broad delegation of authority to the arbitrator, a court may determine the limited question of whether a claim or cause of action is for (i) trade secret misappropriation, (ii) patent infringement, (iii) copyright infringement or misuse, or (iv) trademark infringement or dilution, which are excluded from the definition of "Disputes" as stated above. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. You may choose to engage in arbitration hearings by telephone. Arbitration hearings not conducted by telephone shall take place in a location reasonably accessible from your primary residence (or principal place of business if you are a small business), or as determined by the arbitrator and applicable rules.</p>

    <p>(G) Initiation of Arbitration Proceeding. If either you or Serendipity Apps LLC decide to arbitrate a Dispute, we agree to the following procedure:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Write a Demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the Dispute and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at http://www.adr.org ("Demand for Arbitration: Consumer Arbitration Rules").</li>
        <li>Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to AAA by mail at American Arbitration Association Case Filing Services 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.</li>
        <li>Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party at the same address as the Dispute Notice, or as otherwise agreed to by the parties.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>(H) Hearing Format. In all hearing formats, the arbitrator shall issue a written decision that explains the essential findings and conclusions on which an award, if any, is based. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by Serendipity Apps LLC or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or Serendipity Apps LLC is entitled. The discovery or exchange of non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute may be allowed during the arbitration.</p>

    <p>(I) Arbitration Fees and Payments.</p>

    <p><strong>Disputes involving $75,000 or less.</strong> Serendipity Apps LLC will promptly reimburse your filing fees and pay the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses. If you reject Serendipity Apps LLC's last written settlement offer made before the arbitrator was appointed ("Serendipity Apps LLC's last written offer"), your dispute goes all the way to an arbitrator's decision (called an "award"), and the arbitrator awards you more than Serendipity Apps LLC's last written offer, Serendipity Apps LLC will: (i) pay the greater of the award or $1,000; (ii) pay twice your reasonable attorney's fees, if any; and (iii) reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing your claim in arbitration. The arbitrator will determine the amount of fees, costs, and expenses unless you and Serendipity Apps LLC agree on them.</p>

    <p><strong>Disputes involving more than $75,000.</strong> The AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA's and arbitrator's fees and expenses.</p>

    <p><strong>Disputes involving any amount.</strong> In any arbitration you commence, Serendipity Apps LLC will seek its AAA or arbitrator's fees and expenses, or your filing fees it reimbursed, only if the arbitrator finds the arbitration frivolous or brought for an improper purpose. In any arbitration Serendipity Apps LLC commences, Serendipity Apps LLC will pay all filing, AAA, and arbitrator's fees and expenses. Serendipity Apps LLC will not seek its attorney's fees or expenses from you in any arbitration. Fees and expenses are not included in determining the amount in dispute.</p>

    <p>(J) Claims or Disputes Must be Filed Within One Year. To the extent permitted by law, any claim or dispute to which this Section applies must be filed within one year in small claims or in arbitration. The one-year period begins when the claim or Notice of Dispute first could be filed. If not filed within one year, the claim or dispute will be permanently barred.</p>

    <p>(K) 30-Day Opt-out Period. IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IN THIS DISPUTES SECTION, YOU MUST NOTIFY Serendipity Apps LLC BY E-MAILING privacy@serendipityapps.com WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS (UNLESS A LONGER PERIOD IS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW). In the e-mail, you must provide your (a) first name, (b) last name (c) address, (d) phone number, and (e) account number(s) and state the following: "I wish to opt out of the arbitration provision contained in Serendipity Apps LLC's Terms of Service Agreement." By providing your information in the method above, you are opting out of the agreement to arbitrate contained in Serendipity Apps LLC's Terms of Service. Your opt-out request will only be valid if made within thirty (30) days of first accepting the Universal Terms of Service. In the event that you opt-out consistent with the procedure set forth above, all other terms contained herein shall continue to apply, including those related to the applicable governing law and the court(s) in which legal disputes may be brought.</p>

    <p>(L) Amendments to this Section. Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, you and Serendipity Apps LLC agree that if Serendipity Apps LLC makes any future amendments to the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions (other than a change to Serendipity Apps LLC's address) in these Terms, Serendipity Apps LLC will notify you and you will have thirty (30) days from the date of notice to affirmatively opt-out of any such amendments. If you affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Section as stated in these current Terms, without any of the proposed amendments governing. If you do not affirmatively opt-out of any future amendments, you will be deemed to have consented to any such future amendments.</p>

    <p>(M) Severability. If any provision in this Section is found to be unenforceable, that provision shall be severed with the remainder of these Terms remaining in full force and effect. The foregoing shall not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions; if the prohibition against class or representative actions is found to be unenforceable, this entire Section shall be null and void. The terms of this Section shall otherwise survive any termination of these Terms.</p>

    <p>(N) Exclusive Venue for Other Controversies. Serendipity Apps LLC and you agree that any controversy excluded from the dispute resolution procedure and class action waiver provisions in this Section (other than an individual action filed in small claims court) shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction, and each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts for any such controversy. You also agree to waive the right to trial by jury in any such action or proceeding.</p>
